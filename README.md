Capstone project using Python for data analysis
# World CO2 Emissions Analysis (Capstone Project)

## Objective
To analyze global CO2 emissions data and identify trends, patterns, and insights related to environmental impact across countries and years.

## Dataset
- World CO2 emissions dataset
- Cleaned and analyzed using Python

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend analysis across years and regions
- Visualization of emissions patterns

## Key Insights
- CO2 emissions show significant variation across countries
- Rapid growth in emissions observed in developing regions
- Long-term global emission trends highlight environmental risk

## How to Run
Open the notebook `Dataset1_World_CO2_EDA.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
